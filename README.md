Why 'Kitty Online'?

Why not? Everyone loves kittens. If you don't like kittens you're probably dead inside.

How do I get started?
---

It's easy as 1, 2, 3 (well actually it's, 1, 2, 3, 4...)

1. Clone the repo
1. Create an empty DB
1. Do composer install (weeeeeee)
1. Do doctrine:database:create
1. Do doctrine:schema:create
1. Do doctrine:fixtures:load
1. Go to the app in your browser

(Yes, I've assumed familiarity with setting up Symfony projects and a web server here. Better instructions will come later.)

Go to the 'Blackfire tutorial' tab in the menu and start profiling!
